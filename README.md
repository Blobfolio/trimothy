Trimothy is a small library that expands on the limited String- and slice-trimming capabilities provided by the standard library.

If any of these methods happened to be introduced into stable Rust in the future, they will simply be removed from here.

This crate is `#![no_std]`-compatible.



### TrimSlice

This trait adds the following basic trimming capabilities to `&[u8]`, `Vec<u8>`, and `Box<[u8]>`, similar to those enjoyed by strings.

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `trim` | Trim leading and trailing (ASCII) whitespace. |
| `trim_start` | Trim leading (ASCII) whitespace. |
| `trim_end` | Trim trailing (ASCII) whitespace. |


### TrimSliceMatches

This trait adds the arbitrary, match-based trimming methods to `&[u8]`, `Vec<u8>`, and `Box<[u8]>`:

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `trim_matches` | Trim arbitrary leading and trailing bytes via callback. |
| `trim_start_matches` | Trim arbitrary leading bytes via callback. |
| `trim_end_matches` | Trim arbitrary trailing bytes via callback. |


### TrimMut

This trait brings _mutable_ trimming support to `String`, `Vec<u8>`, and `Box<[u8]>`.

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `trim_mut` | Trim leading and trailing whitespace (mutably). |
| `trim_start_mut` | Trim leading whitespace (mutably). |
| `trim_end_mut` | Trim trailing whitespace (mutably). |


### TrimMatchesMut

This trait brings _mutable_ match-based trimming `String`, `Vec<u8>`, and `Box<[u8]>`.

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `trim_matches_mut` | Trim arbitrary leading and trailing bytes via callback (mutably). |
| `trim_start_matches_mut` | Trim arbitrary leading bytes via callback (mutably). |
| `trim_end_matches_mut` | Trim arbitrary trailing bytes via callback (mutably). |



## Installation

The dependency can be added the normal way:
