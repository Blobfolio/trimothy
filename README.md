Trimothy is a small library that expands on the limited String- and slice-trimming capabilities provided by the standard library.

If any of these methods happened to be introduced into stable Rust in the future, they will simply be removed from here.

This crate is `#![no_std]`-compatible.



### TrimSliceMatches

This trait adds the arbitrary, match-based trimming methods to `&[u8]`, `Vec<u8>`, and `Box<[u8]>`:

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `trim_matches` | Trim arbitrary leading and trailing bytes via callback. |
| `trim_start_matches` | Trim arbitrary leading bytes via callback. |
| `trim_end_matches` | Trim arbitrary trailing bytes via callback. |


### TrimMut

This trait brings _mutable_ trimming support to `String`, `Vec<u8>`, and `Box<[u8]>`.

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `trim_mut` | Trim leading and trailing whitespace (mutably). |
| `trim_start_mut` | Trim leading whitespace (mutably). |
| `trim_end_mut` | Trim trailing whitespace (mutably). |


### TrimMatchesMut

This trait brings _mutable_ match-based trimming `String`, `Vec<u8>`, and `Box<[u8]>`.

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `trim_matches_mut` | Trim arbitrary leading and trailing bytes via callback (mutably). |
| `trim_start_matches_mut` | Trim arbitrary leading bytes via callback (mutably). |
| `trim_end_matches_mut` | Trim arbitrary trailing bytes via callback (mutably). |


### NormalizeWhitespace

This trait exposes an iterator over byte/string slice contents that trims the edges and compacts/converts all inner, contiguous spans of whitespace to a single horizontal space.

This trait is implemented for `&[u8]`, `&str`, and `Iterator`s with `u8`/`char` items.

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `normalized_whitespace` | Return a whitespace-normalizing iterator. |
| `normalized_control_and_whitespace` | Return a control- and whitespace-normalizing iterator. |



## Installation

The dependency can be added the normal way:

```toml
[dependencies]
trimothy = "0.3"
```
